## Introduction

* The Json data loaded by YYEVA is compressed by zlib and then converted to base64.
* The converted data is written in the Metadata section of MP4.

## Field overview

The json contains 3 layers: descript/effect/datas

1. descript: general information describing the resource
2. effect: describe all mask related information under this resource
3. datas:	description The position information of the mask for each frame

## Detail

### `descript`

***General information describing the resource***

![image](./img/descript.png)

1. width,height: width or height of the video
2. isEffect: Whether it is a dynamic element video
3. version": version of plug-in
4. rgbFrame": Position info of rgb
5. alphaFrame": position info of alpha area

### `effect`

***Describe all mask related information under this resource. For each mask, an element will be saved in this field to describe the type-related information of the mask.***

At present, masks are divided into two types: image text, which can be judged according to effectType.

1. Basic Property

	* effectWidth: width of the dynamic element
	* effectHeight: height of the dynamic element
	* effectId: index id of the dynamic element
	* effectTag: tag of the dynamic element of the key for logic code using.
	* effectType: dynamic element type, txt and img

2.	Unique properties

	* text type (effectType == txt)

		fontColor: 
when it is text, it indicates the text color that needs to be specified when rendering on the client side.
		fontSize: 
when it is text, it means the text size that needs to be specified when rendering on the client side.

	* image type (ffectType ==  img)
		saleMode: the stretching method when the image is adapted to the display area of ​​the client. There are three types of values.

		1.	scaleFill:
Don't keep image aspect ratio, surfacing background area, default mode
		2.	aspectFit: Maintain the aspect ratio of the image and scale the image to the smallest size that will completely cover the background positioning area
		3. 	aspectFill: Maintains the aspect ratio of the image and scales the image to the largest size that will fit in the background positioning area

### `datas`

![image](./img/descript.png)

***The position information of the mask for each frame***

For each mask element of each frame, there will be a data segment to describe how the mask element should be displayed in this frame.

* frameIndex: index of frame
* data: all mask information of current frame
* effectId: Indicates which mask the data belongs to, and corresponds to the effectId under the effect. The corresponding mask information can be indexed under the effect.
* outputFrame: Indicates the position information of the mask in the output video area.
* renderFrame: Indicates the position of the mask on the rendering canvas.
